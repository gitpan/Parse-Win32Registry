Revision history for Perl extension Parse::Win32Registry.

** 0.22 2006-08-06

Included the script dumpreg.pl as both a tool for examining
registry files, and as an example.

print_summary now displays 'subkeys' instead of 'keys' to make it
clear what it was referring to.

Offsets that require adjustment by fixed amounts (this applies to
entries in the RGKN block of Windows 95 registry files and to all
entries in the hbin blocks of Windows NT registry files) are now
amended before being stored, rather than at seek time.

More comprehensive tests have been added.

Troubleshooting section added to the documentation.

** 0.21 2006-07-30

Checks added after every sysread, and an attempt made to improve the
error messages presented. Internal error messages have been made
distinct from errors generated when parsing invalid data.

The code that looks up the RGDB entry for Win95 keys has been revised
to remove some duplicate code. It's still too long.

The use of substr and unpack when parsing new NT keys and values
has been reduced.

Reading REG_DWORD values which are not the expected four bytes in
length no longer results in an exception. Similarly, get_data now
returns undef for these values instead of failing.

get_data_as_string updated to return (no data) when get_data returns
an empty string, and (invalid data) when get_data returns undef (which
should only occur for invalid REG_DWORD values).

The undocumented print_debug methods have been updated and added to.
Win95 keys and values could already dump their on-disk structures; now
WinNT keys and values can dump their on-disk structures, and WinNT
keys can dump their offset lists.

Registry files are now opened using the three-argument version of open.

** 0.20 2006-07-23

Released to CPAN.
